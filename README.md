# rumi-safety-service

Resident Safety service of **Rumi**, the structural monitoring platform by Kuntur Labs.

> **SKELETON: functionality planned for later sprints. The health endpoint is NOT counted as an implemented functional endpoint.**

| | |
|---|---|
| Bounded context | Resident Safety |
| Port | `8086` |
| Gateway routes | `/api/v1/evacuation-plans/**`, `/api/v1/checklists/**` |
| Base package | `com.rumi.safety` |

## Purpose

Will own evacuation route maps (US19) and post-quake checklists (US20).
None of it is implemented yet: this repository only fixes the service boundary, its port
and its place behind the API gateway.

## Origin

New service. It has no code in the modular monolith
[`rumi-backend`](https://github.com/upc-pre-202610-1asi0657-grupo4-Rumi/rumi-backend); it is one of the
bounded contexts of the target architecture defined when the monolith was decomposed.

## Endpoints

| Verb | Path | Description | Request | Response | User story | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/v1/evacuation-plans/health` | Check that the service is running | none | `200` `HealthResponse` | none | skeleton |

Implemented functional endpoints: 0. Skeleton endpoints: 1.
